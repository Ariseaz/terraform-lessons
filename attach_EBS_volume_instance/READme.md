# To Administer the EBS Volume

### To Login to remote instance with SSH

ssh -i  mykey -l ubuntu 54.246.195.229

### to switch to root user
```
$ sudo -s
```

to see list of disk
```
$ df -h
```

### Format the disk to ext4 file system
***device_name = /dev/xvdh***

```
mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdh
```

### Mount Data
```
mkdir /data
mount /dev/xvdh /data
```

At this stage this volume needs to go into /etc/fstab
NB: fstab: Fstab is your operating systemâ€™s file system table.

```
vim /etc/fstab
```

Add the following lines
```
/dev/xvdh /data ext4 defaults 0 0
```

mount and unmount data
```
mount
unmount
```

This will make the volume /data always available even after reboot, which will make for Immutable infrastructure
